  This directory contains data files for the image tests in the parent
directory (as stored in the CVS repository).

  The file "saved_rectangle" is the correct result for the 
image save command.  The file "image_test.ppm" is the original image
on which the test operations are performed.  All other files here
(except this README) are nominal results for the image modifications for
which they are named.
