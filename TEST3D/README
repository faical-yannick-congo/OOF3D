This directory contains tests that ensure that OOF3D is installed and
is running correctly.  The tests in this directory only test aspects
of the program that are not related to graphical user interface.  The
GUI subdirectory contains tests for the user interface.

To run the tests, cd to this directory, and type 
    python regression.py
This will run the full suite of tests and create a lot of output.  The
tests were successful if the last output line is "OK", although lines like
  Exception TypeError: "'NoneType' object is not callable" in  ignored
after the "OK" are harmless.

It's possible to run a subset of the tests by running any of the other
.py files in the directory like this:
    python regression.py fundamental_test.py
or like this:
    python regression.py fundamental_test.py skeleton_basic_test.py

Note that not all of the .py files in this directory are 
tests.  If you find you need to run tests one at a time, you can
identify the files that the developers intended to be tests by 
checking the test_module_names list in regression.py.

If any of the tests fail, please send a note to oof_bugs@nist.gov.
Include the output from the test, and let us know the OOF3D version
number, what kind of computer you're using (including the operating
system, compiler, and python version numbers), and how you built and
installed OOF3D.

To run the graphical tests, cd to the GUI subdirectory and read the
README file there.
