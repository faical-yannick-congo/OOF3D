To do for an initial release of OOF2 (version 2.0)

* Complete the mesh construction tools
  * Assign materials to pixels.
  * Finish the pixel group utilities
  * Select pixels in a Microstructure, not just an Image 
  * Finish the mesh construction GUI
  * Create a mesh toolbox for the graphics window
    * manually move nodes
    * manually add edges
    * pin down nodes
    * query elements
  * Add OOF1 mesh modification commands
    * Annealing
    * Refine by selection/depth/size/interface/group
    * Edge swapping
    * Smoothing
  * Simple (non adaptive) quad and triangular mesh directly from pixels.
 
* Element groups
* Active areas 
* Firewalls (may not be necessary, if active areas are implemented well)

* Boundary condition GUI
  * Define edges & sets of edges
  * Define boundary conditions
  * Apply conditions to edges
* Physics GUI (choose equations to solve)
* Solver GUI
* GUIs for pixel and element info

* ppm2oof demography pixel selection tool

* More predefined outputs
  * Von Mises stress
  * Energy of various sorts
* Output along cross sections
* Output averaged over element groups
* Output values at position of mouse click
* Statistical output

* Save mesh, microstructure, image
* Save & restore entire program state

* Converter for OOF1 goof files

* Documentation for implementing new material properties, fields, and outputs

=====================================================

To do for a later release (but not much later)   (version 2.1)

* Separation into front & back end processes
* Extended solver:
  * Plasticity
  * Incremental solver
  * Time dependence
  * Auxilliary fields
  * Nonlinear solver
* More physics (Edwin's OOF1 modifications)
* Line elements
* Investigate Windows port
* Adaptive mesh using a posteriori error estimators
* Automatic grain boundary detection
* Effective properties

=====================================================

To do still later (version 2.x, x>1)

* Parallelization
* 3 dimensions
* Coupling to Molecular dynamics simulations
* Coupling to, incorporation of, or incorporation into fracture codes (FRANC?)
