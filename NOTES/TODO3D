Pre Alpha

VTK issues:
  Build pipelines when layers are created, not at render time.
  Visibility of edges when skeleton/mesh wireframe drawn over image.
  Clipping problems.
  Redrawing too often?

Regression and GUI tests:
  Write tests
  Fix bugs in meshing, solving, viewing

Post-Alpha

Parallelization:
  OpenMP Worker
  Easy things to parallelize:
    Voxel grouping
    Anneal, w/o partitioning
    Refine w/o partitioning?
    Matrix construction
    Vector operations during time stepping
  Find canned matrix solvers

GUI Improvements
  Allowing clipping
  Get rid of the layer editor.
  Interactive clipping plane editing.
  More filters -- pixel group, element group, etc.

Merge with OOF2
  Time stepping
  Nonlinear solvers
  All other improvements from the last n years
