Download setup.exe from the Cygwin website (www.cygwin.com)

Run setup.exe.

Click Next

Select Install from Internet, click Next

Pick a root directory (where the files will end up)
The default of C:\cygwin is usually fine. Click next until you get to the mirror selection.

You need to download cygwin from an official cygwin mirror, and get gnome from another site.  Unfortunately, not all of the cygwin mirrors work, so you'll need to find a working one first. Take your best guess and click next.

Once you find one that works, it will give a list of package categories. Now, click back so you can add in the URL for the GTK libraries.

In the blank by add URL, paste in http://cygnome.sourceforge.net/install . Click Add. Now you should have two sites highlighted, your original one and the one you added at the bottom. If that is not the case, ctrl-click your original mirror. Click Next.

You can install everything, but there is a minimum set that must be installed. If you pick just those, cygwin will also install their dependencies.

Make sure you have at least these selected:
Devel->cvs
Devel->gcc
Devel->make
Devel->swig
Net->openssh
Interpreters->python
GNOME-libs->gtk+
GNOME-libs-devel->gtk+-devel
GNOME-libs->imlib
GNOME-libs-devel->imlib-devel
GNOME-libs->gnome-libs
GNOME-libs-devel->gnome-libs
Graphics->jbigkit
Libs->libxml2
Libs->libpng12-devel

Click Next

Pick what icons you want, and click Finish. Click OK on the dialog box after it finishes with all of the DOS windows.

Startup Cygwin

Download packages.tar.bz2 from the website and put them in the cygwin root directory (C:\cygwin).

Unpack them:
cd /
bzip2 -d packages.tar.bz2 -c | tar xv

Retrieve the OOF2 source code. For example:
mkdir OOF
cd OOF
eval `ssh-agent`		(those are backticks, not single quotes)
ssh-add /cygdrive/a/id_rsa	(your private ssh key)
cvs -d :ext:kstemen@higgins.nist.gov:/users/langer/FE/CVSoof checkout OOF2

Add files to path:
export PATH=/usr/bin/swig-1.1-883:$PATH:/opt/gnome/bin

Now go into the OOF2 directory, make a build directory, configure it, and then compile it:
cd OOF2
mkdir CYGWIN
cd CYGWIN
../configure
make

Setup python:
export PYTHONPATH=.:/usr/local/lib/python2.2/site-packages

Start X Windows (run all of these commands from the same window):
XWin &
export DISPLAY=:0.0

Give yourself a window manager:
twm&

Startup OOF2:
python oof.py -g

A box should appear in your XWindows window. When it does, click somewhere in the XWindows window.
