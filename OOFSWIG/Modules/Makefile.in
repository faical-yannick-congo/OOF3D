# Copied Lulu's modified swig into OOFSWIG, and changed setup.py so that
# it automatically builds and uses it.  The --with-swig option to setup.py
# is still respected, if it's given, but it shouldn't be necessary any more.
#
# Changed make_dist so that the swig output files aren't included in
# the distribution, and removed the --skip-swig option from setup.py.
# Since everybody has swig now, it's no longer necessary.  This will
# make the build take a little bit longer, but users won't have to
# combine the build and install steps anymore.
#
# Removed the bit in pyexp.swg that suppressed the warnings that the old
# swig code generated.  This means that if you use --with-swig, you'll
# probably get lots of warnings.
#
# Added some explicit (char*) casts in PyObject_CallMethod calls in
# swig typemaps, to get rid of warnings in swig generated code.
# For unknown reasons, PyObject_CallMethod has char * arguments instead
# of const char* arguments.   Other similar Python API calls use const.
